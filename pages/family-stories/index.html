                    <p class="story-metadata">Told by Martha McCoy Johnson (granddaughter of Randolph McCoy), Recorded 1952</p>
                    <div class="story-excerpt">
                        <p>My grandmother never spoke much about that night, but my father told me what he remembered. He was just a boy when it happened. It was bitterly cold, he said, with snow on the ground. The family had gone to bed after celebrating the New Year when they heard the dogs barking.</p>
                        <p>My great-grandfather Randolph got up to see what was happening. That's when the shooting started. The Hatfields had surrounded the house. My father said his mother pushed him and his siblings under a bed while Randolph tried to defend the home.</p>
                        <p>The most terrible part was when they set the house on fire. My aunt Alifair was shot when she stepped outside, and my uncle Calvin was killed too. My grandmother Sarah was beaten so badly she never fully recovered. Randolph escaped into the woods, but he lost everything that night - his home, two of his children, and in many ways, his wife too.</p>

                    <div class="story-excerpt">
                        <p>Grandfather was a changed man after his baptism in 1911. The family was shocked when he announced he wanted to be baptized. He'd never been a religious man during the feud years - quite the opposite. But something changed in him as he got older.</p>
                        <p>He told my father that he'd been having dreams about judgment day. In these dreams, he said he could see all the men who had died during the feud years, and they were pointing at him. After these dreams started, he couldn't sleep through the night.</p>
                        <p>The day of his baptism, hundreds of people came to see it. Nobody could believe that Devil Anse Hatfield was being baptized. They held it in Main Island Creek, and grandfather walked into that cold water wearing a white shirt. When he came out, he told everyone that the feud was truly over for him.</p>

                    <div class="story-excerpt">
                        <p>When I first met Shirley Hatfield at the factory in Detroit, I didn't tell her my name right away. I knew who she was as soon as I heard her last name and where she was from. I was nervous about how she might react when she found out I was a McCoy.</p>
                        <p>We worked side by side for two weeks before I finally told her. I remember saying, "You know, my maiden name is McCoy." She just looked at me for a moment, then laughed and said, "Well, I guess we're supposed to be feuding, aren't we?"</p>
                        <p>After that, we became good friends. We were both far from home, working to support the war effort. When the Life Magazine people came around looking for a story, someone told them about us. We didn't think it would be such a big deal, but they made us pose together and took all those pictures.</p>

                    <p>My great-grandfather always maintained that Floyd Hatfield stole that hog. It wasn't just any hog - it was a special breed with distinctive markings that my great-grandfather had been raising. In those days, hogs were valuable property, especially one like that.</p>
                    
                    <p>The way the story was passed down in our family, Randolph recognized his hog on Floyd Hatfield's property and confronted him about it. Floyd claimed the hog was his, born and raised on his land. But Randolph knew his own livestock.</p>
                    
                    <p>When they took the dispute to the local justice of the peace, who happened to be related to the Hatfields, the case came down to the testimony of Bill Staton, who was connected to both families. He testified in favor of the Hatfields, and Randolph lost the case.</p>
                    
                    <p>My grandfather used to say that it wasn't really about the hog itself - it was about respect and being treated fairly. The Hatfields had more influence with local officials, and Randolph felt he couldn't get justice. That sense of injustice festered and contributed to the bad feelings between the families.</p>
                    
                    <p>Of course, I never knew if the hog really was stolen or not. That's just how the story was told in our family. The Hatfields probably have a completely different version of the same event.</p>`

                    <p>My grandfather Johnse was known as quite the charmer. The family stories say he could talk his way into or out of just about anything. When he met Roseanna McCoy at that election day gathering, he was immediately taken with her, despite knowing who her family was.</p>
                    
                    <p>The way my father told it, Johnse and Roseanna truly did fall in love. It wasn't just some passing fancy. When Roseanna left her family to be with Johnse, it caused an uproar in both families. The McCoys felt betrayed, and the Hatfields were suspicious of her intentions.</p>
                    
                    <p>Devil Anse, my great-grandfather, never approved of the relationship. He didn't trust any McCoy, even Roseanna. He refused to let Johnse marry her, which broke her heart. Eventually, she returned to her family, but they weren't exactly welcoming either.</p>
                    
                    <p>The saddest part of the story is what happened after. Roseanna had Johnse's baby, but the child died as an infant. And Johnse, well, he moved on and married Nancy McCoy, Roseanna's cousin, which was seen as the ultimate betrayal.</p>
                    
                    <p>My father said that Johnse regretted how things ended with Roseanna for the rest of his life. He wasn't a bad man, just impulsive and not always thoughtful about the consequences of his actions.</p>`

                    <p>The killing of those three McCoy boys was the darkest chapter of the feud, according to my grandfather. He wasn't directly involved, but as a justice of the peace, he knew all about it. The way he told the story, it all started with the election day fight and the stabbing of Ellison Hatfield.</p>
                    
                    <p>When Ellison was stabbed 26 times by the McCoy brothers, the Hatfields were furious. They took the McCoy brothers - Tolbert, Pharmer, and Bud - into custody while they waited to see if Ellison would survive. They held them in a schoolhouse on the Kentucky side of the Tug Fork.</p>
                    
                    <p>When word came that Ellison had died, Devil Anse and his men took the McCoy brothers to Pawpaw Creek. They tied them to pawpaw bushes and executed them. My grandfather said it was a form of frontier justice - "an eye for an eye" - but he also said it was the act that made the feud truly irreconcilable.</p>
                    
                    <p>After that, there was no going back for either family. The McCoys demanded justice through the courts, but the Hatfields controlled much of the local law enforcement in West Virginia. The killing of those boys led directly to the later violence, including the New Year's Night raid on Randolph McCoy's home.</p>
                    
                    <p>My grandfather always said that if cooler heads had prevailed after Ellison's stabbing, much of the later bloodshed might have been avoided. But once those boys were executed, there was no path to peace.</p>`

                    <p>Even though the worst of the feud was over by the time I was born in 1915, its shadow still hung over our family. My grandfather Jim never talked about it directly to us children, but we knew something terrible had happened. There were whispers among the adults, conversations that stopped when we entered the room.</p>
                    
                    <p>I remember as a child, we were taught to be wary of anyone with the Hatfield name. If we went into town and encountered Hatfields, we were supposed to keep our distance. Not that there was any real danger by then, but old habits and old fears died hard.</p>
                    
                    <p>School was sometimes difficult. Other children would tease us about being McCoys, asking if we were going to start a feud with them. Teachers would sometimes treat us differently too, especially if they weren't from the area originally. They'd heard the stories and had their own ideas about what our family was like.</p>
                    
                    <p>My mother tried to shield us from the worst of it. She'd tell us that the past was past and that we should judge people by their own actions, not their family names. But then my grandfather would make some comment about "those Hatfields" and we'd know the old wounds were still there.</p>
                    
                    <p>It wasn't until I was grown and had children of my own that my father finally told me the full story of what had happened to our family during the feud years. I think he wanted to protect us from that burden when we were young, but eventually felt we needed to understand our family history.</p>`

                    <p>When Devil Anse died in 1921, it truly marked the end of an era. My father took me to the funeral, though I was just a small boy. I remember the crowds of people who came - not just family, but people from all over the region. Some came out of respect, others out of curiosity to see the legendary Devil Anse laid to rest.</p>
                    
                    <p>The funeral was held at his home on Island Creek. They brought his body down from the house and placed it in a special wagon for the procession to the family cemetery. I remember how quiet it was, despite all the people. My father pointed out important people to me - politicians, businessmen, even a few McCoys who had come to pay their respects.</p>
                    
                    <p>What struck me most was how my grandfather Cap and his brothers looked that day. These were hard men who had fought in the feud and seen terrible things, but they wept openly for their father. It was the only time I ever saw my grandfather cry.</p>
                    
                    <p>After the burial, they announced that a statue would be erected at the grave. That marble statue still stands today - a life-sized depiction of Devil Anse. My father told me later that Devil Anse had arranged for the statue before his death, paying for it with timber money. He wanted to ensure he wouldn't be forgotten.</p>
                    
                    <p>And he hasn't been. That day marked the passing of the man who had come to symbolize the feud, but in many ways, it also marked the beginning of the feud's transformation into legend and folklore.</p>`

                    <p>Working in that factory during the war was hard, but we all felt we were doing something important. When I first met Frankie McCoy, I had no idea who she was. We were just two girls from Kentucky working side by side in Detroit, making uniforms for soldiers.</p>
                    
                    <p>I remember the day she told me her maiden name was McCoy. There was this moment of recognition between us - we both knew what it meant. But the funny thing was, neither of us cared much about the old feud. We were young women in a big city, far from home, doing our part for the war effort.</p>
                    
                    <p>When the Life Magazine people found out about us, they made a big deal of it. "Hatfield and McCoy Working Together" - that was the angle they wanted. They had us pose for all these pictures, pretending to be working while we smiled for the camera. It felt a bit silly to us, but we went along with it.</p>
                    
                    <p>After the article came out, we got letters from all over the country. Some people wrote to say how wonderful it was that the feud was finally over. Others wanted to know if we were really friends or if it was just for the magazine. We were friends, of course. The feud meant nothing to our generation.</p>
                    
                    <p>Frankie and I stayed in touch for many years after the war. When we both eventually moved back to Kentucky, we'd visit each other occasionally. Our families thought it was strange at first, but they got used to it. I think our friendship did more to heal old wounds than any official reconciliation could have.</p>`

I was nervous about attending, but my wife insisted it was time to put the past behind us. The event was organized as part of the Bicentennial celebrations - a symbol of reconciliation in America's 200th year.</p>
                    
                    <p>When we arrived in Pikeville, there were already dozens of people there from both families. The organizers had name tags for everyone that showed which family you belonged to. At first, people mostly stuck with their own family groups, eyeing the other side cautiously.</p>
                    
                    <p>The ice began to break during lunch. I found myself sitting across from a Hatfield man about my age. We started talking about our jobs - he was a coal miner, and I worked for the railroad. Soon we discovered we had both served in Vietnam, just a few years apart but in the same region. Suddenly, the family names didn't seem to matter so much.</p>
                    
                    <p>By the end of the day, Hatfields and McCoys were mingling freely, sharing family stories, and even discovering distant connections we hadn't known about. Someone brought out old family photographs, and we all gathered around to identify ancestors and relatives.</p>
                    
                    <p>The most powerful moment came when the oldest living descendants of both families shook hands in front of everyone. There was a spontaneous applause, and I saw tears in many eyes, including my own. It felt like a weight had been lifted - not just from the two men shaking hands, but from all of us.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since that day, the reunions have become regular events. My children and grandchildren have grown up knowing Hatfields as friends, not enemies. The feud has become just a story from the past, not a living reality that shapes our lives.</p>`

                    <p>As the unofficial Hatfield family historian, I've spent decades collecting stories, photographs, and documents related to our family's past. The feud is just one chapter in our history, albeit the most famous one. I've tried to document all aspects of our family story, not just the conflict with the McCoys.</p>
                    
                    <p>When I started researching our family history in the 1970s, many older relatives were reluctant to talk about the feud. There was still shame associated with it, a sense that it reflected poorly on the family. But as I persisted, people began to open up, sharing stories that had been passed down through generations.</p>
                    
                    <p>What I discovered was that the real story was far more complex than the simplified version most people know. Yes, there was violence and hatred, but there were also attempts at reconciliation, moments of cooperation, and individuals on both sides who opposed the fighting.</p>
                    
                    <p>I've also found that interest in our family history has grown tremendously in recent years. I receive emails and letters from Hatfield descendants all over the country who want to know more about their roots. Many are surprised to learn that the feud involved only a small portion of the extended Hatfield family.</p>
                    
                    <p>Working with McCoy family historians has been particularly rewarding. We've compared notes, shared documents, and sometimes discovered that our family stories contradict each other. Rather than arguing about which version is "correct," we've come to appreciate how memory and storytelling shape our understanding of the past.</p>
                    
                    <p>My hope is that by preserving these stories - the good, the bad, and the complicated - we can help future generations understand their heritage in all its complexity. The feud will always be part of our story, but it doesn't define who we are today.</p>`

                <p class="story-metadata">Told by Martha McCoy Johnson (granddaughter of Randolph McCoy), Recorded 1952</p>
                
                <img src="../../images/story-new-years-night.jpg" alt="Winter landscape similar to the night of the New Year's attack" class="modal-image">
                
                <p>My grandmother never spoke much about that night, but my father told me what he remembered. He was just a boy when it happened. It was bitterly cold, he said, with snow on the ground. The family had gone to bed after celebrating the New Year when they heard the dogs barking.</p>
                
                <p>My great-grandfather Randolph got up to see what was happening. That's when the shooting started. The Hatfields had surrounded the house. My father said his mother pushed him and his siblings under a bed while Randolph tried to defend the home.</p>
                
                <p>The most terrible part was when they set the house on fire. My aunt Alifair was shot when she stepped outside, and my uncle Calvin was killed too. My grandmother Sarah was beaten so badly she never fully recovered. Randolph escaped into the woods, but he lost everything that night - his home, two of his children, and in many ways, his wife too.</p>
                
                <p>My father said they spent the rest of that night hiding in the woods, terrified the Hatfields would find them. It was so cold that some of the younger children nearly froze. When morning came, neighbors found them and took them in.</p>
                
                <p>After that night, my great-grandfather was a changed man. The loss of his children and home broke something in him. He became obsessed with bringing the Hatfields to justice. He spent years pursuing legal action against them, which eventually led to the trials and convictions of several Hatfield family members.</p>
                
                <p>My grandmother Sarah never recovered from the trauma of that night. My father said she would sometimes wake up screaming, thinking the house was on fire again. She died a few years later, her health ruined by the beating she received and the grief of losing her children.</p>
                
                <p>The New Year's Night attack was the worst single incident of the feud, and it changed both families forever. It transformed a relatively contained conflict into something much more brutal and public. After that night, there was no possibility of reconciliation between Randolph McCoy and Devil Anse Hatfield.</p>`,
                
                "conversion": `<h3>Devil Anse's Conversion</h3>
                <p class="story-metadata">Told by William Hatfield (grandson of Devil Anse Hatfield), Recorded 1965</p>
                
                <img src="../../images/story-devil-anse-conversion.jpg" alt="Baptism scene similar to Devil Anse's conversion" class="modal-image">
                
                <p>Grandfather was a changed man after his baptism in 1911. The family was shocked when he announced he wanted to be baptized. He'd never been a religious man during the feud years - quite the opposite. But something changed in him as he got older.</p>
                
                <p>He told my father that he'd been having dreams about judgment day. In these dreams, he said he could see all the men who had died during the feud years, and they were pointing at him. After these dreams started, he couldn't sleep through the night.</p>
                
                <p>The day of his baptism, hundreds of people came to see it. Nobody could believe that Devil Anse Hatfield was being baptized. They held it in Main Island Creek, and grandfather walked into that cold water wearing a white shirt. When he came out, he told everyone that the feud was truly over for him.</p>
                
                <p>After his baptism, he became much more peaceful. He would sit on his porch for hours, reading the Bible that the preacher had given him. He couldn't read very well, so he'd ask family members to read passages to him. He was particularly interested in stories about forgiveness and redemption.</p>
                
                <p>In his final years, he even expressed regret about the feud. He never spoke publicly about it, but within the family, he acknowledged that much of the bloodshed could have been avoided. He told my father once that he wished he could apologize to Randolph McCoy for the suffering both their families had endured.</p>
                
                <p>When grandfather died in 1921, his funeral was attended by hundreds of people, including some McCoys. The marble statue that stands at his grave today was commissioned before his death. Some people see it as a sign of vanity, but I think it was his way of ensuring that people would remember not just the feud, but also his redemption at the end of his life.</p>
                
                <p>His conversion and the peaceful final decade of his life are often overlooked in stories about the feud, which tend to focus on the violence and conflict. But for our family, his transformation is an important part of the story - a reminder that even the most hardened heart can change.</p>`,
                
                "life-magazine": `<h3>Working with the Enemy</h3>
                <p class="story-metadata">Told by Frankie McCoy Williams (featured in the 1944 Life Magazine article), Recorded 1978</p>
                
                <img src="../../images/story-life-magazine.jpg" alt="Factory workers during WWII" class="modal-image">
                
                <p>When I first met Shirley Hatfield at the factory in Detroit, I didn't tell her my name right away. I knew who she was as soon as I heard her last name and where she was from. I was nervous about how she might react when she found out I was a McCoy.</p>
                
                <p>We worked side by side for two weeks before I finally told her. I remember saying, "You know, my maiden name is McCoy." She just looked at me for a moment, then laughed and said, "Well, I guess we're supposed to be feuding, aren't we?"</p>
                
                <p>After that, we became good friends. We were both far from home, working to support the war effort. When the Life Magazine people came around looking for a story, someone told them about us. We didn't think it would be such a big deal, but they made us pose together and took all those pictures.</p>
                
                <p>The article made it seem like we were the first Hatfield and McCoy to ever get along, which wasn't true. By the 1940s, many members of the younger generations had moved past the old hatred. But I suppose it made for a better story to portray us as breaking some long-standing taboo.</p>
                
                <p>What the article didn't mention was that Shirley and I had a lot in common beyond our famous last names. We were both from rural Kentucky, both had brothers serving overseas, and both were sending money home to help our families. The war had a way of putting old conflicts in perspective.</p>
                
                <p>After the article was published, we received letters from all over the country. Some people wrote to congratulate us on ending the feud, as if two young women working in a factory could undo generations of conflict. Others wanted to know if we were afraid of retaliation from our families, which made us laugh. Our parents were proud of us for doing our part for the war effort.</p>
                
                <p>Shirley and I remained friends after the war. We both eventually moved back to Kentucky, though to different parts of the state. We'd visit each other when we could, and our children grew up knowing each other. Our friendship wasn't anything extraordinary to us, but I suppose it did symbolize how the relationship between our families had changed over the generations.</p>
                
                <p>Looking back, I'm proud that our story helped change perceptions about the feud. We showed that Hatfields and McCoys could not only coexist peacefully but could form meaningful friendships. The hatred that drove the feud had no place in our generation's world.</p>`
