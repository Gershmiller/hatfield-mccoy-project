## 1944 Life Magazine Article

### Background
- In May 1944, Life magazine published an article revisiting the Hatfield-McCoy feud nearly 50 years after the violence ended.
- The article was titled "Hatfields and McCoys now fight together in the Army, work together in mines and factories in their oldtime feuding territory."
- The article was meant to show how the two "famous families now live together in peace" in the Tug Valley area between Kentucky and West Virginia.
- The timing coincided with World War II, when national unity was being emphasized.

### Key Content
- The article interviewed descendants of both families about the rivalry and relations between the two families five decades after the conflict ended.
- Among the photographs was a shot of two young women, Shirley Hatfield and Frankie McCoy, working together in a local factory that produced military uniforms.
- The photograph showed Shirley Hatfield (17) and Frankie McCoy posing together, smiling and speaking lightly of the past troubles.
- According to sources, the two women were described as "the best of friends."
- The image was meant to symbolize the unifying effect of America's war efforts at the height of World War II.
- The photograph was taken by Walter Sanders for Time Life Pictures (later Getty Images).

### Significance
- The article represented a significant shift in the narrative of the Hatfield-McCoy feud, from one of bitter enmity to peaceful coexistence.
